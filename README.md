# Community-detection-metrics-in-MATLAB
This repository conntains various MATLAB codes for evaluating community detection algorithms.

Input: $\mathbf{F}\in\mathbb{B}^{n,k}$ is a binary community assignment matrix, and $\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix.

Note: Definitions for _performance_ and _coverage_ can be found at https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/community.html, definition for _permanence_ can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2426, and ComputeQ (_modularity_) is stolen from https://github.com/smartyfh/DNMF/blob/master/computeQ.m.
